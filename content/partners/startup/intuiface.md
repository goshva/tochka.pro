why: >-
  In 2011, we started as a small team of developers from Toulouse that is
  dedicated to the creation of technology that would make interactivity
  accessible to the masses, releasing a software platform infused with its DNA.
  Ever since, we have been aspiring to deliver a solution that gives everyone
  the power to create interactive experiences. With our Dev team in the heart of
  our evolution, we are excited to support this event organized for like-minded
  people who are also our inspiration.
