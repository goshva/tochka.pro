Have you heard of the code-sharing feature in Kotlin, accompanied with "Write once, run everywhere" slogan? Among its users not only libraries and frameworks authors; there are some projects which have already adopted multiplatform for production. Their applications, written in Kotlin for *both* iOS and Android, are published in stores. 
With this talk, you'll get a brief overview of the evolution of multiplatform technology in Kotlin, concerning the tasks it's evolved to solve. How it was and how it is expected to be; what has changed and which tasks can be already solved with it. What are the facilities right now and which real projects already use multiplatform?
