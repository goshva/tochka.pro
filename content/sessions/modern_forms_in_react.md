If the new React Context API and Suspense killed Redux (they didn't), surely Hooks kill the need for a form library, right? Well, not exactly. Managing form state is more than just holding your current values in state; it's about sync and async validition errors, and much more! But that doesn't mean that Hooks are irrelevant to the situation. Hooks make building forms in React easier than ever before.
