A lot of things have been said about WebAssembly inside of the
browser; after all, that's why it was originally created. But a new
case is emerging as well, and that's WebAssembly on the server. More
specifically, we're seeing a rise of support for WebAssembly in
serverless application platforms, combining two brand-new technologies
together. We're also seeing a lot of growth of the Rust programming
language, and its close alignment with WebAssembly. In this talk,
Steve will talk about Rust, WebAssembly, serverless technologies, and
how it all fits together.
