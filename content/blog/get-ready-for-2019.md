Today it is with great pleasure that we announce you that the 4th edition of DevFest Toulouse will take place **October 3rd 2019 at the center of congress Pierre Baudis**.

As last year, the event will be right in the city center, in the Compans Cafarelli neighborhood. The center of congress Pierre Baudis is accessible by the subway, bus or even by car. This year we will have **more space**, **more sponsors** and **more attendees**
