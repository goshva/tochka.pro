I love science and I love data! After finishing a PhD in genetic engineering, I continued my quest for discovering new patterns through data science and machine learning. I currently work as a Data Scientist and I play with machine learning algorithms on my free time. Someday, I wish to leverage artificial intelligence and genetics to improve people's life.
