Kotlin QA since 2017. Writing Kotlin code on a daily basis to be one of the first persons who try the things around Kotlin, mostly tooling; multiplatform is the biggest and a favorite part â€” made 200+ posts answering the users when we've announced Kotlin Multiplatform 1.3 for the first time. I have a rich mobile apps QA background, used to be a Java developer for a little while at the very beginning of the carrier.
